Budget Check Utility Functions

This module provides functionality to check budget for documents in draft status
before submission, particularly useful for approval workflows.

This module hooks into the server-side validate event to perform blocking
budget validation when documents are saved in draft status.

	Server-side validate hook to check budget for documents in draft status.

	This function is called automatically via doc_events hooks in hooks.py

	is enabled for the doctype and performs budget validation if so.

	Args:
		doc: The document being validated
		method: The event method name (not used, required by Frappe hooks)

		This function relies on ERPNext's native budget validation.
		Any budget violations will be raised as exceptions that block
